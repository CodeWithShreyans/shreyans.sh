# Who is this guy?

Hey there, I'm Shreyans Jain, a 16-year-old "kid" from Agra, UP, India (the place with the not-so-white not-so-wondrous wonder of the world). Right now, I'm feeling pretty confused about life in general and trying to figure out what to do with my time. That's why I decided to start this blog! I'm really into all things tech, food, and anything that catches my interest. I like to think of myself as a full-stack web dev, with Next.js as my weapon of choice. I also know a thing or two about Python, C, Rust, and Go. I'm an entrepreneur at heart, and my first startup was [Duelance](https://duelance.app/). I'm also a fierce [debater](https://www.16personalities.com/profiles/938d92a845a72).

# What's this thing gonna be about?

This blog is gonna mostly be about stuff in the software world, especially developer stuff. I might also share personal updates and talk about new things I'm working on. I know my first few articles might not be the best, but I hope to get better with time.

# What's next?

I'm already working on the first blog post. It's a question that I had but couldn't find a good answer, or even an answer at all. It's also going to require a significant amount of research, so stay tuned. I also post on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Destroyer_Xyz) sometimes, so you can check me out there as well.

# Feedback?
